# NPR-SPH
A project to showcase non-photorealistic rendering and smoothed-particle hydrodynamics.


**The non-photorealistic shaders:**

    Functions:
        - User can select outline color, background color, dark tone, mid tone and highlights.
        - For SPH Particles, user can change particle sizes. 
        

    1. _Cel Shader_

    Implemented Cel/Toon shading which is based on cook-torrance lighting where user can also adjust specular values.

    Implemented based on phong shading where user can also adjust specular values.

    - Each brush stroke is a rectangular stroke with fading opacity and variations in opacity and color at each corners.
